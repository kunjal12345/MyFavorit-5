        <p id="p1">For any professional artist, the famous Disney sister duo, Anna and Elsa, is easy to draw. But it is not the same for beginners. A YouTube channel called "Farjana Drawing Academy", from Bangladesh, has made this task easy for all novice artists across the world by showing them how to adopt an artist's hidden tricks - measurements, ratio and shading.</p>

        <p id="p2">Operated by Farjana Akhter, from Cumilla, these drawing hacks have made this channel so popular among novice artists that a few of the videos have one million, five million and even 14 million views.On the channel, Farjana uploads trendy art content that attracts teenager and other young viewers.</p>

        <p id="p3">Farjana Drawing Academy holds the fifth position in terms of the highest number of subscribers in Bangladesh.Farzana shared she earns around USD 16,000 per month from this channel. Before becoming a YouTube content creator, Farjana used to be one of those young people who drew secretly.After coming home from school, Farjana would eagerly stare at the wall clock for hours for it to turn to six. It was time for her father to start drawing pictures in their living room.</p>

        <p id="p4">Farjana started giving drawing lessons to children in Cumilla. Meanwhile, she continued her education and was also gathering knowledge on freelancing. During the time, Farjana learned about YouTube marketing, creating channels and monetizing the channels. Farjana figured out that there were not many tutorials for art beginner art enthusiasts.Farjana opened her channel and uploaded her first content titled "How to draw a banana step by step" at the beginning of 2017.</p>

        <p id="p5">This had Farjana hooked and she continued uploading. In a few days, she started to get requests from all over the world to create content on various topics. She tried to keep as many requests as she could.Farjana, however, has always believed in simplicity and quality. She draws with a DOMS (Zoom Ultimate Dark) pencil that costs only Tk5. But she has never compromised with quality and maintains it strictly. It takes her four days to shoot and edit one content.</p>
